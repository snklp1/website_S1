      <p>Things aren't as layed back as they used to be. But once in a while, I do make sure to take some time out for myself. These activities are some of those. </p>

          <h2>Reading</h2>
          <p>I don't read very often, but I sure enjoy whenever i do</p>
          <p>Here's <a href="favbooks.html">"A List"</a> of the books i think can be enjoyed by anyone.</p>

          <h2>Badminton</h2>
          <p>I used to play badminton daily, but recent lifestyle of mine has forced it out. I dont blame the conditions but only myself for letting it go away.</p>

      <div class="stg">
        <img class="stgimg" src="images/anime3.gif" alt="Anime">
        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <p class="top-para">The love for Anime developed within me when I watched Deathnote, and since then, there was no going back. I understand it takes some time for one to truly appreciate it all. The kind of stories which you come across here can't be matched anywhere else. I, myself, have helped many realize this fact and hence in the process got them addicted as well.</p>
        <p>Here is <a href="Anime.html">"Another List"</a>, a compilation of my favorite anime.</p>

        <img class="stgimg" src="images/cycling.gif" alt="travelling">
        <h2>Cycling/Trekking</h2>
        <p>The cool air of a morning run can last all day long. While most of my time is spent glued to some screen, I would like to step out of the house more often. Oh, how much I miss the Pre-lockdown days...</p>

      <div class="stg">
        <img class="stgimg" src="images/talk.gif" alt="talking">
        <h2>Discourse</h2>
        <p>May it be political debate, a conversation about the ever expanding universe or even one about your daily struggles, I am all ears to hear it all out. I see communication as a skill which i aim to develop futher, hence ever ready to participate.</p>
