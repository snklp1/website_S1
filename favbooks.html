      <p>Books provide stories which allow us to form our own image in our minds. Everyone sees the same story but have different visual interpretations. Maybe that's what which makes it all so interesting. Well, I'm no speacialist on books and might leave out some of the most fantastic ones out. These are just the ones I know of. </p>

    <div class="">
      <h3 class="book-names">Harry potter series</h3>
      <img class="booksimage" src="images/hpotter.png" alt="">
      <p id="book1">This isnt on the first place its my favorite or something. I have been highly sceptical of franchises which turn over to movies. I generally stay away from such books (but the list is contradictory :(, I know). But harry potter is really well written and i wish to read all of them someday when i get time.</p>

    <div >
      <h3 class="book-names">Inferno</h3>
      <img class="booksimage" src="images/inferno.png" alt="">
      <p id="book1"> I am currently reading this and it feels very well structureed to me. Since I too have tried my hand at putting out a story of similar scope and scale, reading it gives me great insight on how to actually write one.</p>

    <div class="">
      <h3 class="book-names">Percy jackson series</h3>

      <img class="booksimage" src="images/pjbook.png" alt="">
      <p id="book1"> I like the percy jackson series. They accomplish what they meant to be and never deviat or try to achieve anything higher or lower than what was promised. </p>
      <br>

    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3 class="book-names">Foundation and empire</h3>

      <img class="booksimage" src="images/fandempire.png" alt="">
      <p id="book1"> I havent read this one yet but i wish to some day. I've heard great things about this one and the foundation series in general. </p>
      <br>

    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3 class="book-names">The lord of the rings series</h3>

      <img class="booksimage" src="images/lotr.png" alt="">
      <p id="book1">This is what inspired the modern fantasy genre, so this is worth reading.</p>
